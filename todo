possible check against inappropriate names before user registration

either put the companies in a table, in their own forms, or put them in a combo box within a single form...

If They are put in a table, then I could add links to the Company Homepages!!

add a javascrript confirm action when selecting a Company!

users without a company cannot be logged in
